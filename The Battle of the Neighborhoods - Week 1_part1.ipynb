The five times larger metropolitan area of Brussels comprises over 2.5 million people, which makes it the largest in Belgium. Brussels is known for its cuisine and gastronomy,as well as its historical and architectural landmarks.\n\nBrussels is best known for moules-frites (mussels and fries), beer and chocolate. But look beneath the surface and you\u2019ll find a vibrant food scene, providing a real flavour of 21st-century Belgium.\nBelgium, and Brussels in particular, has always excelled at decadent dining. Rich desserts follow indulgent meat dishes, with local cuisine reflecting a strong influence from neighbouring countries France and the Netherlands. But it\u2019s not all moules-frites and carbonnade flamande. Many new establishments have popped up in recent years, particularly restaurants that celebrate the city\u2019s diverse, multicultural communities.\n\nDifferent diasporas have made the Belgian capital home since the end of World War II and the city\u2019s development as the home of the European Union, with a swathe of young chefs leading the way when it comes to modern dining. Whether it\u2019s hole-in-the-wall spots that celebrate the city\u2019s more recent arrivals from the Middle East or fine-dining restaurants that pay homage to both Asian and Belgian cuisine, you\u2019re not likely to run out of places to try.
